## Introduction

This is my repository for Scientific Programming Concepts comprising of all the practical assignments. This repository, titled sciprog_24, contains my practical assignments for the 2024-2025 academic year, focused on Scientific Programming using the C language.

## Project Workflow
The repository is divided into main branch and distinct branches for each practical, following a structured and consistent format:

### Main Branch

* Houses the README.md file with an overview of the repository and general guidelines.
* Each practical branch has been merged to main branch
  
### Practicals-Specific Branches
* Each branch is named practical<number> and contains:
* Source Code: The primary C files for the assignment.
* README.md: Detailed instructions on:
* How to compile the code.
* Steps to execute the program.
* Output of the code
